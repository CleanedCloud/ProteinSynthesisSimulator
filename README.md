# üß¨ ProteinSynthesisSimulator

ProteinSynthesisSimulator is a Java-based application dedicated to simulating the intricate molecular processes of protein synthesis, a fundamental biological process. This simulator is especially beneficial for bioinformatics studies, offering a detailed understanding of the steps and components involved in protein synthesis.

## Concepts managed Overview:

- **Cell**: Represents the basic structural, functional, and biological unit of all organisms. The environment where all the processes, including protein synthesis, take place.

- **Nucleus**: Represents the cell's command center, containing the genetic material (DNA) that dictates protein synthesis.

- **Chromatin**: Represents the material within the nucleus comprising DNA and protein. It condenses to form chromosomes during cell division.

- **Helix**: Represents the twisted structure of the DNA double helix, storing genetic information.

- **DNA**: Represents the deoxyribonucleic acid, a molecule that carries genetic instructions for the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of all known living organisms.

- **mRNA**: Stands for Messenger RNA. It carries genetic information from the DNA to the ribosome.

- **NucleicAcid**: Represents the molecules that comprise the structure of RNA and DNA.

- **EnzymePool**: Manages a collection of enzymes, ensuring their availability and allocation during various biochemical reactions.

- **Enzyme**: Simulates biological molecules that act as catalysts and help complex reactions occur everywhere in life.

- **Polymerase**: Simulates the enzyme responsible for synthesizing long chains or polymers of nucleic acids.

- **Ribosome**: Represents the molecular machine that synthesizes proteins by translating the genetic information from mRNA.

- **tRNA**: Stands for Transfer RNA. Helps decode mRNA sequences into proteins by carrying the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome.

- **Codon**: A sequence of three nucleotides forming a unit of genetic code, specifying a particular amino acid.

- **AminoAcid**: Represents the building blocks of proteins. There are 20 different types in total.

- **Protein**: Mimics the end product of protein synthesis, comprising one or more long chains of amino acids.


## Protein Synthesis Explained:

Protein synthesis is the process by which cells make proteins, based on the instructions encoded in DNA. It occurs in two main stages:

1. **Transcription**: Inside the nucleus, the DNA sequence of a gene is transcribed into mRNA. The enzyme RNA polymerase reads the DNA sequence and synthesizes a complementary mRNA strand.

2. **Translation**: The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. Here, ribosomes read the mRNA sequence and translate it into a sequence of amino acids, creating a protein. tRNAs help in this process by bringing the right amino acids based on the codons in the mRNA.

The ProteinSynthesisSimulator encapsulates this entire process through the defined classes, ensuring an in-depth understanding of the intricate steps involved in protein synthesis.
